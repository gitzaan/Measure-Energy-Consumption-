## Project Overview

This project aims to revolutionize the management of energy consumption data by developing an automated system for measuring, analyzing, predicting, and visualizing energy usage. Our goal is to enhance efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making across various sectors by harnessing the power of data science and machine learning.

## Project Phases

- **Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking**
  - Identified challenges in manual energy data collection and analysis.
  - Key features include predictive modeling, interactive dashboards, and anomaly detection.

- **Phase 2: Innovation and Practical Steps**
  - Focused on practical steps to bring the project to life.
  - Included data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model development, visualization, and automation.

- **Phase 3: Data Preparation**
  - Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values.
  - Data splitting, normalization, and reshaping for machine learning.
  - Demonstrated data before and after normalization and reshaping.
  - Prepared the Data for use in the LSTM model.

## Conclusion

In Phase 3, we prepared our energy consumption data for machine learning. We cleaned the dataset, split it for training and testing, and normalized it for model compatibility. We visualized data transformations before and after normalization and reshaping for LSTM modeling. These steps set the stage for our upcoming model development in Phase 4.
