## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of advanced time series analysis and machine learning techniques in forecasting and anomaly detection. The project uses a dataset of hourly electricity production data from American Electric Power (AEP) to predict future electricity production and detect anomalies in the data.

## Dataset 

  Dataset Link : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption?select=AEP_hourly.csv)
  - This is a time-series dataset that contains hourly energy consumption in MegaWatts. The data spans from 2004 to 2018 and contains 121,273 data points.

## Project Phases
  - Phase 1: Problem Definition
  - Phase 2: Innovation and Design Thinking
  - Phase 3: Data Preprocessing and Visualization
  - Phase 4: Model Training and Evaluation
  - Phase 5: Documentation
